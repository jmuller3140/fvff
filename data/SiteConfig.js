Capturing reality through the eyes of orphans being raised in a monastery, this film explores the gift of children celebrating their youth despite the difficult circumstances life has presented them. A Little Wisdom is director Yuqi Kang’s intimately observed portrait of orphaned monks living in an isolated monastery in Lumbini, Nepal. In the birthplace of the Buddha, we follow the daily routine of novice monk Hopakuli, and his older brother Chorten, left by their mother at Karma Samtenling Monastery. Kang lived at the monastery for a year prior to filming Hopakuli, Chorten and the other young monks. A Little Wisdom’s subtle rhythms and symbols evoke Buddhist teachings while showing the contradictions between Hopakuli’s austere monastic upbringing and a child’s natural fascination and longing for the world beyond Lumbini.",

        description: "What is disposable in this world? What is the definition of family? Who deserves a home? This film captures the dreams and desires of orphans. It illustrates their struggles to come to terms with their feelings of worth and belonging in a world which has dealt them the much too early loss of their parents. Via arguments on stairways, recorded interviews for potential adoptees, fights in hallways, feet stepping tenderly down ladders and muffled tears in bunk beds it illustrates how the deep need to have a home and family effects their every move. In an orphanage housing about 20 children, we can hear their wonderings, see them fight to be chosen, guess their fears and their dream to be part of a family. Why not put them online, in order to boost their adoption?",

The anchor of the man who is left behind preserves the dignity of the immigrant experience and expression. An invitation to analyze what history we preserve into memory and what we try to deny and leave behind. The human race has found refuge in outer space after abandoning Earth long ago.

From toucans to doves seeing the miraculous in the everyday adornment of wings is a choice and a story unto itself. The Bird Painter shows a short fable telling how the birds got their colors and why the doves did not. Told through watercolor and inked paper puppets along with lovely lyrical song, The Bird Painter is a film of charm that is not to be missed.",

The younger son leaves home squanders his fortune, eventually becoming destitute. Starving, he returns home intending to work for his father as a servant.

This film is a reminder to stay open minded and vigilant, to look towards the light of someone’s unique voice while celebrating what their individual vision may offer the world as a whole. The society and our fears do not let our dreams come true. Whether it’s a dream or goal, we have to struggle and most of the time, the struggle is met with an obstacle which prevents us from going further. The society is for the rich. They confine the dreams of poor to a closed glass space in which the poor can see but can not get out of it. But still its in human nature to struggle and that struggle must never stop.",
